introudciton: This clib includes my general c libraries. The lib just a excersie,
            : rewriten from scratch. And this project may not be written regularly.
	    : If some recommendations, contact me. I will very glad.
	    : The library supports debug with gdb.

How to use this library
---------------------------
 Just include the head file in your source, as:
	
	#include"cio.h"
 
 But when you compile with this library, you have two ways.
 On one hand, you build your program with imported library, i.e., "libcio.a".
	
	gcc -c your_program.c -I$(LIBDIR)
	gcc -o your_program.exe your_program.o -L$(LIBDIR) -lcio
 
 NOTE: $(LIBDIR) is just the path where this libray and head file exists. 
 For example:
		
		/f/Prj/clib
		
 On the other hand, you also build your program without imported library.

	gcc -o your_program.exe your_program.o $(LIBDIR)/cio.dll

How to rebuild this library
---------------------------
It is very simple.

	$ make clean
	
	$ make

NOTE: '$' is your command line promt.
